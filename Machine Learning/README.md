# Capstone Machine Learning
A repository containing the source code for the ML portion and models of our caption project: Cassava Disease Detection

# System Overview
Making a machine learning model by using Convolutional Neural Network for image classification

# Step-by-step Guide
1. Install all prerequisites, such as:
	* TensorFlow (2.6.0)
	* Numpy (1.22.3)
	* Matplotlib (3.5.2)
	* Python (3.9.12)
2. Download the Dataset
	* Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cassava-disease/overview/description
3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
	* Load data into tf.Dataset
	* Data visualization
	* Split into training and test set
	* Data augmentation
4. Model Building
	* Build and train CNN model
	* Plot training history
	* Make a prediction from a sample image
5. Save the model

# Things to Improve
At the moment the model that is implemented is not yet perfect, so thereâ€™s room for improvement.
